# RugbyScoreCounter

This is a project for Udacity Google Challenge Scholarship: Android Basics.

I used to play rugby at university. Rugby has complex rules for scoring points. Team can get 7 points for Penalty Try, 5 points - for Try, 3 points for Penalty Goal or Dropped Goal and 2 points for Conversion Goal. It's  difficult to keep in mind score of both teams and quickly calculate new score. So I decided to create a counter app for a rugby score.
